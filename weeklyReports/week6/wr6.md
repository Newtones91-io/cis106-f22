## Wildcards

### The * Wildcard

The `*` Wildcard matches zero or any number of characters in a filename.

* Examples:
![asterisk_wildcard](*_wildcard.png)

### The ? Wildcard

The `?` Wildcard matches precisely one character in a filename. It is very useful when working with hidden files.

* Examples:
![?_wildcard](question_mark_wildcard.png)

### The [] Wildcard

The `[]` Wildcard matches a single character in a range. The brackets wildcard `[]` can use the exclamation mark `!` to reverse the match.

* Examples:
![brackets_wildcard]([]_wildcard.png)

### Using Brace Expansion 

Brace expansion is not a wildcard, but another feature of the bash shell that allows you to generate arbitrary strings to use with commands.

* Examples:
![brace_expansion](brace_expansion.png)
